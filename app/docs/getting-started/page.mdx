# Getting Started

Create your first AI workflow in minutes.

## Prerequisites

You'll need API keys from at least one AI provider:

- **OpenAI** - For GPT models, DALL-E, and audio transcription
- **Google** - For Gemini models and Imagen
- **Anthropic** - For Claude models

## The Interface

When you open Composer, you'll see:

- **Canvas** - The main area where you build flows by placing and connecting nodes
- **Add Node** - Button at the bottom to open the node palette
- **Run** - Execute your flow
- **Preview** - Right sidebar showing outputs from your flow

## Creating Your First Flow

### 1. Add a Text Input Node

Click **Add Node** and drag a **Text Input** node onto the canvas. This is where you'll enter your prompt.

### 2. Add a Text Generation Node

Add a **Text Generation** node. This node sends your input to an AI model and returns a response.

### 3. Connect the Nodes

Drag from the output port (right side) of the Text Input node to the input port (left side) of the Text Generation node. A cyan line will appear showing the connection.

### 4. Add an Output Node

Add a **Preview Output** node and connect it to the Text Generation node's output. This displays the final result in the preview sidebar.

### 5. Configure and Run

1. Type a prompt in the Text Input node
2. Select your AI provider and model in the Text Generation node
3. Click **Run** to execute the flow

Your AI response will appear in the Preview sidebar.

## Next Steps

- Explore [all node types](/docs/nodes) to see what's possible
- Try adding image generation or audio transcription to your flows
- Share your flow with collaborators using the Share button
