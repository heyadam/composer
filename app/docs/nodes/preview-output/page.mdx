# Preview Output

Display final results from your flow.

## Overview

The Preview Output node is the exit point of your flow. It sends connected data to the Preview sidebar for display.

## Ports

| Port | Type | Direction | Description |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| Response | Response (amber) | In | Streaming text response |
| Code | Response (amber) | In | React component code for preview |

## Usage

Connect the output of your final processing node to a Preview Output node. When you run the flow, results appear in the Preview sidebar on the right.

## Multiple Outputs

You can have multiple Preview Output nodes in a flow. Each one creates a separate entry in the Preview sidebar, allowing you to see multiple results at once.

## Streaming

Preview Output nodes display streaming responses in real-time. As Text Generation nodes produce output, you'll see it appear character by character.

## Code Preview

When connected to a React Component node's Code output, the Preview sidebar renders the generated component in a sandboxed iframe.

## Debug Mode

Toggle debug mode in the Preview sidebar to see detailed information about each node's execution, including request/response data.
