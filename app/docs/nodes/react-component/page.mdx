# React Component

Generate interactive React components from descriptions.

## Overview

The React Component node uses AI to generate React components based on your description. The generated components are rendered in a sandboxed preview.

## Ports

| Port | Type | Direction | Description |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| Description | String (cyan) | In | What the component should do |
| Instructions | String (cyan) | In | Additional system instructions |
| Code | Response (amber) | Out | Generated component code |
| Done | Pulse (orange) | Out | Fires when generation completes |

## Configuration

### Provider & Model

Select your AI provider and model for code generation:
- OpenAI GPT models
- Google Gemini models
- Anthropic Claude models

## Usage

1. Describe the component you want (e.g., "a todo list with add/remove buttons")
2. Optionally provide additional instructions for styling or behavior
3. Run the flow
4. The generated component appears in the Preview sidebar

## Preview

Connect the Code output to a Preview Output node to see the rendered component. The preview uses a sandboxed iframe for security.

## Tips

- Be specific about functionality and appearance
- Mention any libraries or styling preferences
- Describe interactive behavior explicitly
