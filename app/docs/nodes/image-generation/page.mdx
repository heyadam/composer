## Overview

The Image Generation node creates images from text prompts using OpenAI DALL-E or Google Gemini/Imagen models.

## Ports

|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| Prompt | String (cyan) | In | Image subject/description |
| Style | String (cyan) | In | Style instructions (e.g., "anime style", "oil painting") |
| Base Image | Image (purple) | In | Optional source image for image-to-image transformation |
| Output | Image (purple) | Out | Generated image |
| Done | Pulse (orange) | Out | Fires when generation completes |

## Tips

- Use the **Prompt** input for the subject (what to generate)

- Specify composition, lighting, and mood in either input
