# Text Input

Entry point for text data in your flow.

## Overview

The Text Input node provides a text area where you enter content that flows to connected nodes. It's the most common starting point for AI workflows.

## Ports

| Port | Type | Direction | Description |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| Output | String (cyan) | Out | The text you entered |

## Usage

1. Add a Text Input node to your canvas
2. Type or paste text into the text area
3. Connect the output to a processing node (like Text Generation)

## Caching

Text Input nodes are automatically cached. The node only re-executes when the text content changes.

## Tips

- Use multiple Text Input nodes to provide different inputs to the same processing node
- Connect to the "system" input of a Text Generation node for system instructions
- Connect to the "prompt" input for the user message
