# Introduction

Composer is a visual AI workflow builder that lets you create multi-model pipelines by connecting nodes on a canvas.

## What is Composer?

Composer provides a drag-and-drop interface for building AI workflows. Instead of writing code, you connect nodes visually to create pipelines that can:

- Generate text with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic)
- Create and manipulate images
- Transcribe audio to text
- Build real-time voice conversations
- Transform data with AI-generated code

## Key Features

### Multi-Provider Support

Use models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic in the same workflow. Switch between providers without changing your flow structure.

### Visual Flow Editor

Build workflows by dragging nodes onto a canvas and connecting them with edges. See data flow through your pipeline in real-time.

### Real-Time Collaboration

Share your flows with others and collaborate in real-time. See collaborator cursors and changes as they happen.

### Incremental Execution

Composer caches node outputs, so only nodes with changed inputs re-execute. This saves time and API costs when iterating on workflows.
